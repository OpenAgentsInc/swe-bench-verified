# SWE-bench Verified High Score Project

## Project Overview

Welcome to our project dedicated to achieving high scores on SWE-bench Verified. Our goal is to develop and implement strategies that will maximize our performance on this benchmark, which is designed to evaluate AI models' ability to solve real-world software issues.

## About SWE-bench Verified

SWE-bench Verified is a human-validated subset of the original SWE-bench dataset, released by OpenAI. Here are some key points about this benchmark:

1. It consists of 500 samples verified by human annotators to be non-problematic.
2. It addresses issues in the original dataset, such as overly specific unit tests and underspecified problem statements.
3. The benchmark aims to provide a more accurate evaluation of AI models' software engineering capabilities.
4. On SWE-bench Verified, GPT-4o resolves 33.2% of samples, more than doubling its previous score on the original SWE-bench.

## Using the Dataset

We'll be using the ðŸ¤— Datasets library to work with the SWE-bench Verified dataset. Here's how we'll access and use the dataset:

1. Install the required library:
   ```
   pip install datasets
   ```

2. Login to Hugging Face (you'll need to do this once):
   ```
   huggingface-cli login
   ```

3. Load the dataset in your Python script:
   ```python
   from datasets import load_dataset

   dataset = load_dataset("princeton-nlp/SWE-bench_Verified")

   # If the dataset has splits, you can load them separately:
   # train_dataset = load_dataset("princeton-nlp/SWE-bench_Verified", split="train")
   # valid_dataset = load_dataset("princeton-nlp/SWE-bench_Verified", split="validation")
   # test_dataset  = load_dataset("princeton-nlp/SWE-bench_Verified", split="test")
   ```

4. Explore and use the dataset in your model development and testing.

For more detailed information on working with datasets, refer to the [ðŸ¤— Datasets documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/).

## Our Approach

To achieve high scores on SWE-bench Verified, we will:

1. Thoroughly analyze the benchmark's structure and requirements.
2. Develop strategies to effectively parse and understand problem statements.
3. Implement robust code generation techniques.
4. Create a system for thorough testing and validation of our solutions.
5. Continuously iterate and improve our approach based on performance feedback.

## Project Goals

1. Achieve a score significantly higher than the current 33.2% benchmark set by GPT-4o.
2. Develop innovative techniques for solving software engineering tasks.
3. Contribute to the advancement of AI capabilities in real-world programming scenarios.
