# SWE-bench Verified High Score Project

## Project Overview

Welcome to our project dedicated to achieving high scores on SWE-bench Verified. Our goal is to develop and implement strategies that will maximize our performance on this benchmark, which is designed to evaluate AI models' ability to solve real-world software issues.

## About SWE-bench Verified

SWE-bench Verified is a human-validated subset of the original SWE-bench dataset, released by OpenAI. Here are some key points about this benchmark:

1. It consists of 500 samples verified by human annotators to be non-problematic.
2. It addresses issues in the original dataset, such as overly specific unit tests and underspecified problem statements.
3. The benchmark aims to provide a more accurate evaluation of AI models' software engineering capabilities.
4. On SWE-bench Verified, GPT-4o resolves 33.2% of samples, more than doubling its previous score on the original SWE-bench.

## Our Approach

To achieve high scores on SWE-bench Verified, we will:

1. Thoroughly analyze the benchmark's structure and requirements.
2. Develop strategies to effectively parse and understand problem statements.
3. Implement robust code generation techniques.
4. Create a system for thorough testing and validation of our solutions.
5. Continuously iterate and improve our approach based on performance feedback.

## Project Goals

1. Achieve a score significantly higher than the current 33.2% benchmark set by GPT-4o.
2. Develop innovative techniques for solving software engineering tasks.
3. Contribute to the advancement of AI capabilities in real-world programming scenarios.
